Below in this article, I have shared the ideal CPU temperature range, safe CPU temperature, and all the other things you need to know. Most of the users monitor the performance and speed of their CPU while gaming or during normal use. However, it is not so. One of the most imperative aspects that you should always be concerned about is the temperature of the CPU.',

        'When you use your system for general purposes, you may hardly notice your CPU getting hot. There are two things to show you here, one perspective is while gaming, and the other is normal use. When you play games on your system, you will witness your CPU running at 70-80 degrees Celsius.It can be safe, but at the same time, it is at the borderline because 90 degrees is the threshold heating temperature while gaming on your CPU. You should always keep it consistent at 60-70 degrees Celsius; otherwise, the heat may damage your CPU. While in general use, when you use heavy applications, you should have the temperature of your CPU limited within 40-70 degrees Celsius. This will offer you an extended life span of your CPU',
        'When your computer is idle or not doing anything strenuous, you should anticipate it to be between 50 and 55 degrees Celsius. It should ideally stay at or below 80 degrees Celsius while under load.This is true for both laptops and desktop computers. Things may get hotter faster if you’re using a laptop, especially a thinner one like a MacBook Air or a notebook. Idle temperatures should be at 60 degrees Celsius, while load temperatures should be around 80 to 90 degrees Celsius.',
